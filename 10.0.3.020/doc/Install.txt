Obtaining Intel MKL 

Before installing Intel MKL, you should check the File
Downloads section of Intel(R) Premier Support to see if a newer
version or update is available. The version on CD or as listed in your
electronic download license letter may not be the most current.  In
order to download and install a version from Intel Premier Support,
you will first have to register for support as described under
Technical Support.



Installing Intel MKL 


Pre-Installation Instructions

Note: the default installation directory for the Intel MKL 
10.0 is /opt/intel/mkl/10.0.xxx ,
where xxx is the package number, 
for example, /opt/intel/mkl/10.0.039.


Installation Instructions

To install the Intel MKL package on Linux*, use the following
instructions. The installation software installs the full Intel MKL
file set for all supported processors. See the Intel MKL website for
updates, when available.

   1. Do either of the following

      A. Installing from the downloaded package

         Unpack the Intel MKL package in a directory 
         which you have write access to:

         >tar -zxvf  l_mkl_p_10.0.xxx.tgz
         
         where xxx is the package number.

      B. Installing from CD

         Insert an Intel MKL CD into your CD-ROM device 
         and mount it.

   2. Run the installation script

      A. Installing from the downloaded package

         Execute the install script in the directory where the tar file
         was extracted:

         > cd l_mkl_p_10.0.xxx
         > ./install.sh
         
         where xxx is the package number. 

      B. Installing from CD

         Execute the install script in the directory where your CD-ROM
         device was mounted:

         > cd <directory where your CD-ROM device was mounted>
         > ./install.sh

   3. The install script will display a series of options:

        1. Install 
        2. Readme
        3. Release Notes
        4. Installation Guide
        h. Help
        x. Exit

      Option 1 is used to install Intel MKL. Options 2 - 4 and h
      can be used to obtain additional information before
      installing.

      Type 1 and press Enter to begin the installation.

   4. You will then be prompted to enter your serial number,
      the path to your license file or select a different 
      option:

      Please make your selection by entering an option from the choices 
      below:

        1. Provide your serial number [Recommended] 
           Use this option if you have a serial number to install and
           register your software. The Intel(R) Software Setup Assistant
           may connect to the Intel(R) Registration Center to verify your
           serial number. Please refer to the Intel(R) Privacy Policy 
           regarding the collection and handling of your personal 
           information. Your Serial Number is in XXXX-XXXXXXXX format.
        2. Provide the absolute path for an existing license file.
           Use this option if you have obtained a license file instead 
           of a serial number.
        3. Where do I find my Serial Number? 
        4. Intel(R) Privacy Policy
        b. Go Back.
        h. Help. 
        x. Exit.

      Please type a selection or Serial Number:

      The serial number and a license file were provided to you when
      you purchased the product, either in an e-mail from the reseller
      or on a sticker attached to the CD-ROM package.

      If you are connected to the internet, type your 
      serial number and press Enter. The correct license file will be
      automatically downloaded and installed to your system.

      If you cannot connect to the internet, select option 2 and 
      enter the absolute path to the license file.

   Note: If the install detects that you already have a valid license
            on your system, the first option will be:

          1. Use existing license found on the system. [Recommended]

   5. If you are not logged in as root, you will be asked if you want
      to install as root (recommended), which will update the system
      RPM database, or not as root, which won't use the system RPM
      database. Use the non-root install if you want to install to a
      private area.

   6. The install script then extracts the product and does some
      prerequisite checking. If any other versions of Intel 
      MKL are installed on the system, they will be
      displayed.

      Press Enter to proceed with installation, or type x to exit the
      install program.

   7. Press enter again to display the license agreement. After the
      license agreement is displayed, you are prompted to accept or
      reject the license. If you accept the license, type accept and
      press enter. If you reject the license, type reject and press
      enter to end the install.

   8. After temporary files have been extracted, a list of currently
      installed versions of Intel MKL will be displayed. 
      If you wish to uninstall any of the previous versions, type the 
      number next to the first version you want to uninstall or press 
      Enter to uninstall all the versions. After the uninstall is 
      finished you will be returned to this screen.

      Type c to continue with the installation.

   9. You will be prompted for an install location. Press Enter to
      select the default location, or type another path. If you are
      installing with a non-root account, you will need to choose a
      location that you have write permission for.

      Please wait while the installation proceeds and when it
      completes, press Enter to continue.
  
  10. After the install program deletes temporary files, you will 
      be returned to the first installation menu (see step 3 above).

      Type x and press Enter to quit.

  11. You may be prompted to register for the Intel(R) Premier 
      Support, if you used the serial number that was not yet 
      registered. After the registration, the install script exits.
      
Note that Fortran 95 interface libraries for LAPACK and BLAS are 
delivered as source code, and you need to build them yourself. See the 
"Fortran 95 Interfaces and Wrappers to LAPACK and BLAS" section in 
the Intel MKL User's Guide on how to do this.


Installation Warning for RPM 4.0.2, 4.1, 4.2.1(x64), 3.0.5

These RPMs cannot install to a non-default directory. This has been
resolved in next versions of RPM.


Silent Installation


Silent installation enables installing Intel MKL on a single Linux machine 
in a batch mode, without input prompts.
To run silent installation, 
   1. Log in as root
   2. After the command prompt, enter 
      ./install.sh --silent [<file>] [{--serialnumber <SN>, --licensepath <LP>}]

      where <file> is the name of the install configuration file, which contains 
      answers to questions that the installer asks. The <file> parameter is 
      optional. If it is not specified, the installer will use the file 
      SilentInstallConfigFile.ini in the “data” directory of the Intel MKL package.
      --serialnumber / --licensepath option enables providing Intel MKL serial 
      number <SN>/ license path <LP> right in the command line. --serialnumber 
      and --licensepath are mutually exclusive and optional. If any of these options
      is specified, it overrides the appropriate setting, if any, in the 
      configuration file. 
      
Note that it is your responsibility to create the configuration file 
./data/SilentInstallConfigFile.ini . To do this, you are encouraged to use the 
--duplicate option (described below).

Silent installation is especially helpful in case you have to replicate the 
installation on multiple similarly configured machines, such as cluster nodes. 
In this case, you should first save the configuration of your installation. 
To do this, run interactive installation with an additional option:
./install.sh --duplicate [<file>]

Running the installation with this option will cause a file to be created that
contains all your answers to questions asked. The optional <file> parameter, if 
supplied, determines the file to be created. If the parameter is not supplied, 
the file with the name MySilentInstallConfigFile.ini will be created in the same 
directory as the installer. If this directory is read-only, then the /tmp/mkl/ 
directory will be used. If the file already exists, it will be overwritten.

Examples:
./install.sh --silent
Runs silent installation using the default configuration file 
SilentInstallConfigFile.ini in the “data” directory. Note that 
default configuration files that ./install.sh --duplicate creates and 
./install.sh --silent consumes are different.

./install.sh --silent /path/to/mysilentconfig.ini
Run silent installation using /path/to/mysilentconfig.ini configuration file

./install.sh --silent --serialnumber XXXX-YYYYYYYY
Runs silent installation using the default configuration file and the serial number 
specifed in the command line. Note that with the --serialnumber / --licensepath option
supplied, the installation will run silently without the --silent option: 
./install.sh --serialnumber XXXX-YYYYYYYY

./install.sh --silent --licensepath /path/to/mylicense.lic
./install.sh --licensepath /path/to/mylicense.lic
Runs silent installation using the default configuration file and the license path 
specified in the command line.

Note: If the installer cannot find the configuration file, which is explicitly 
specified or assumed by default, the former will complete with an error message, 
which for the last example above will look like “ERROR: Cannot read 
../data/SilentInstallConfigFile.ini!”. The configuration file must also have at 
least read permissions.



Uninstalling Intel MKL 

Follow the instructions below to uninstall Intel MKL.

If you've installed Intel MKL as root, 
  1. Log in as root. 
  2. To uninstall, run
    <MKL-install-dir>/uninstall.sh .
    If you've installed Intel MKL to the default directory, use
    /opt/intel/mkl/10.0.xxx/uninstall.sh ,
    
    where xxx is the package number

Note: 

Uninstalling Intel MKL does not delete the 
corresponding license file.
